This project introduces "SpeedEye," an advanced system engineered for real-time 
traffic surveillance and speed analysis utilizing the YOLO v8 (You Only Look Once version 
8) object detection framework.SpeedEye emerges as a comprehensive solution tailored to 
address these challenges by providing accurate speed estimation, vehicle classification, and 
detailed data reporting capabilities. At its core, SpeedEye leverages computer vision 
techniques to monitor vehicle movement in input video streams.YOLO v8, renowned for its 
efficiency in real-time object detection, serves as the backbone of the system, enabling rapid 
and accurate identification of vehicles within the video frames.Through this integration, 
SpeedEye ensures seamless tracking of vehicles, essential for deriving meaningful insights 
into traffic dynamics. The primary objective of SpeedEye is to facilitate informed decision
making processes for traffic management authorities.First, it accurately estimates the speeds 
of detected vehicles using sophisticated algorithms. Speed estimation is crucial for 
understanding vehicle behavior and identifying potential traffic violations, such as 
overspeeding. Moreover, SpeedEye classifies vehicles into distinct categories based on their 
type, size, and behavior. This classification enables authorities to discern between different 
vehicle classes, each with its specific implications for traffic management. For instance, 
distinguishing between cars, trucks, and buses helps in understanding traffic composition 
and planning infrastructure accordingly.Furthermore, SpeedEye ensures comprehensive data 
reporting, a critical aspect of its functionality.The system generates detailed Excel reports 
containing essential information such as vehicle speeds, counter IDs, and vehicle 
classifications. These reports serve as valuable resources for traffic management authorities, 
offering insights into traffic patterns, trends, and potential areas for improvement.One of the 
distinguishing features of SpeedEye is its ability to identify overspeeding vehicles with 
precision. By setting predefined speed thresholds, the system flags vehicles exceeding these 
limits, allowing authorities to take proactive measures to address speeding violations. 
Overspeeding vehicles are segregated into separate Excel sheets, enabling focused attention 
on enforcement efforts.Through continuous refinement and adaptation, SpeedEye aims to 
remain at the forefront of traffic surveillance technology, contributing to safer and more 
efficient roadways worldwide.In conclusion, SpeedEye represents a significant advancement 
in traffic management technology, offering a comprehensive solution for real-time speed 
analysis and vehicle classification.By harnessing the power of YOLO v8 and advanced data.
